- Software Development Manager with over 5 years of experience
- Never worked as a Software Engineer (have a huge experience in Business Analysis though), I know some basics of Python, JavaScript. I'm familiar with most of the concepts, the training for me is to get different perspective
- My daily driver laptop is on Linux, which caused me to rething my life when "ls" didn't work in cmd ;)
- Father of 2,5 year old Anatol
- I used to work as a Journalist, and I'm addicted to reading news.
Hence one of the websites I open everyday is [Feedly](https://feedly.com/), a news aggregator
